In this project, we formulate hallucination detection as a supervised time series classification problem, and present
new datasets, which include both token-level hallucination annotations and model logits. 

This project includes both manual analysis and learning-based approaches, with the goal of predicting hallucinations using the logits output of LLMs.
While this "gray-box" method improved upon other hallucination detection tests, it was concluded that many challenges remain before proper detection can be made.
